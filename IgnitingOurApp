npm init
npm install -D parcel
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npx parcel index.html //give the entry point to run the application

//File Watcher Algorithm -- C++
//BUILDING
//MINIFY
//Cleaning our Code
//Dev and Production Build
//Super Fast Algorithm
//Image Optimization
//Caching while development
//Compression
//Compatible with older version of browser(It adds polyfills)
//HTTPS on dev
//port number
//Consistent Hashing Algorithm
//Zero Config
//Tree Shaking --remove unwanted code

Why REACT is fast??(needs a lot of things )(bundler acts as a catalyst)()

//we should push .parcel-cache in our git ignore 

//Transitive dependencies (parcel uses like (one depends on others) )
//**we have our pakage manager which handles and takes care of our transitive dependencies of our code..**/

//browserList with countryName

package.json vs package-lock.json
package-lock.json --> tells a exact version of the libraries
package.json -->in this dev dependencies it will automatic upgrade a package use of package

dependencies vs devDevepndencies
devDevepndencies --> install locally 
Devepndencies --> install globally
