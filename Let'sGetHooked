react usess one way data binding


to use a local variable we need to use those state variables that state variable are created using hooks 
const [searchText] = useState(); //to create state varivale
//SearchText is a loccal state variable
this function i.e useState returns an array and the first vsriable of this array i.e serachText is variable name

//what is state??

//what is hooks??
Hooks is just a function
//what is useState??


//why do we need state variable??
suppose we have a local variable let a=10;
and some function change it to 11;
react will not know i have to update that variable (whereevr that variable is to be called);
so for this i have to create a state variable and all the state varible we have to create react will keep track on them...







if(searchClicked === "true"){
                    setSearchClicked("false");
                }else{
                    setSearchClicked("true");
                }
